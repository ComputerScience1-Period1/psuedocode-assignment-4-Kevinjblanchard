War pseudocode
By: Kevin Blanchard - 1st period

INSTRUCTIONS
Set the table by giving each player an equal deck of cards, randomly shuffled. Jokers should be removed from the deck.
Each player plays the top card from their deck at the same time and the player with the highest card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their stack.
If the cards have the same value, each player places down three cards face down and one card face up. 
The player with the higher card gets all of the played cards played that turn.
If the cards are the same again, repeat the process until the cards are different.

TURNS
Remove jokers from the deck.
Shuffle the deck.
Give each player an equal fraction of the deck.
Ace is the highest valued card.
2 is the lowest valued card.
All cards in between are valued in chronological order from 2 to ace.
//All of these on handling the cards sould have been in the instructions and not part of your code. 

While (players have > 0 cards in hand){
  All players place the top card of their deck into the middle area.
    If a single player has a card greater than any other player{
      player with the highest valued card takes all of the cards in the middle and puts them at the bottom of his deck.
        }
      }
  While (2 >= players played = card values){
